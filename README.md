# Implementing Facenet-Face-Recognition Model

This is an implementation of the "[FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf)" and "[DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf)"

This code is documented so you can follow along while reading with the paper. You can also add your own images and to test again the model.

Result Example:

<img src="images/camera_0.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<h2> It's Younes, Welcome Home!</h2>

# How to run

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- cv2
- os
- pandas
- Scipy
- Numpy

* See others in first run cell of the notebook

References:

The pretrained model we use is inspired by Victor Sy Wang's implementation and was loaded using his code (https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace)
